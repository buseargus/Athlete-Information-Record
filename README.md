# Athlete-Information-Record
An athlete information recording application based on the use of doubly linked list data structure. It also has a simple user interface.

  - The "athlete.txt" file is read when the program is first opened and the records in the file can be viewed sorted alphabetically in the user interface.
  - A new athlete record can be added.
  - An existing athlete record can be deleted.
  - By typing the name (with surname) of an athlete, details about that athlete can be accessed if there is a record in the system.
  - When exiting the program, the latest status of the records is written back into the "athlete.txt".
